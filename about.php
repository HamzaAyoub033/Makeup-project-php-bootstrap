    <h3>About Online Makeup Store </h3>
                    
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    The main place to buy Makeup is traditionally the tannery. 
    Unfortunately this method of buying presents various limits and difficulties, 
    both logistic / geographical and commercial. In Italy the tanneries are reunited, almost exclusively, 
    in three industrial poles, Campania, Tuscany and Veneto, for those who do not live nearby, the journey, 
    besides being long, is also expensive, not to mention those who live abroad. Moreover, based on the quantity 
    that you want to buy, there are two opposite problems, if the quantity is low, 
    the tannery will not follow the order as it usually requires a minimum order quantity, 
    if instead it is conspicuous, not all the means are suitable for transporting it; the makeup in fact, 
    besides being bulky, weighs a lot.

    Another problem is that almost all the tanneries are very specialized, they develop one or two types of makeup, 
    designed for specific jobs, normally, in the warehouse of a tannery,
    one does not find great variety or availability. </p><br>

    <h3>Buy makeup from traditional traders and wholesalers</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Traditional Makeup wholesalers, with their warehouses overflowing with makeup products, 
    are certainly an option for those who want to buy small quantities of makeup. 
    Normally a finished makeup merchant keeps a good variety in stock, which can include cow, sheep, 
    and perhaps exotic skins, articles for footwear and makeup goods, tanned in 99% of the cases 
    in chrome and more rarely in vegetable. It is more difficult to find "hair on" hides, upholstery 
    or belt and saddlery makeups. Unfortunately, even traders, like tanneries, are concentrated in 
    the production centers, close to the tanneries for the convenience of going to choose and move materials, 
    or close to the footwear or makeup goods poles in the case of stock makeup. In short, 
    it is very difficult to disentangle between the various types and for those who do not live 
    in places with tradition in makeup processing, going to visit a merchant's warehouse can be 
    very expensive in terms of time and costs, without considering the fact that to find the product 
    you are looking for probably needs to visit more places that are often confusingly organized.
